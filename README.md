## Description

Todos is a basic Todo List web application. I build it to refresh my knowledge of basic React concepts, such as adding, editing and deleting array properties, props propagation, state management and component creation. I added an updated date label at the top and a nice delete all tasks button that becomes sticky if there are many tasks.

## Key Features

- Add, Edit, Delete Tasks
- User-Friendly Interface
- Responsive Design

## Built with
